### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Toh Pin Ren, a second-year Computer Science undergraduate student at the National University of Singapore (NUS).

I enjoy backend development and I'm deeply passionate about building highly efficient systems that can scale gracefully to tackle real-world problems. I'm interested in the finance and healthcare space.

In my free time, I enjoy:
- Exploring different cuisines and food experiences
- Travelling and discovering new places and cultures
- Trying out all kinds of sports
- Hiking and reconnecting with nature
- Capturing moments through photography
- Watching films
