### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pin Ren Toh, a third-year (Junior) Computer Science undergraduate student at the National University of Singapore (NUS).

I'm deeply passionate about building highly efficient systems that can scale gracefully to tackle real-world problems.

In my free time, I like trying out different foods and engaging in various sports. Traveling to new places brings me joy, and I have a deep appreciation for hiking and the beauty of nature. I also enjoy taking photos and watching films.
